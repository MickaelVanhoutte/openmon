# Weather Completion - Decisions

## 2026-02-06 Session Start

### Scope Decisions

- Gen 5-8 mechanics (NOT Gen 9 Snow)
- Skip primal weathers
- Skip form changes (Castform, Cherrim)
- Include Rock duration items

### Implementation Decisions

- Recovery abilities (Rain Dish, Ice Body, Dry Skin, Hydration) already exist - SKIPPED
- Overcoat: Weather damage immunity only (powder move immunity deferred)
