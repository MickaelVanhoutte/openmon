The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its [HP]{mechanic:hp} reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.

[]{item:life-orb} and berries that cause [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} still work as normal, but their respective [HP]{mechanic:hp} loss and [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} are absorbed/blocked by the doll.

The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the [field]{mechanic:field}, such as by []{move:pursuit} or []{move:spikes}; however, the doll will block the [poison]{mechanic:poison} effect of []{move:toxic-spikes}.
