Self-inflicted damage from [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.  Moves that work based on the user's [HP]{mechanic:hp} still do so; the doll's [HP]{mechanic:hp} does not influence any move.

The doll will block [major status effect]{mechanic:major-status-effect}s, [confusion]{mechanic:confusion}, and [flinch]{mechanic:flinch}ing.  The effects of []{move:smelling-salts} and []{move:wake-up-slap} do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate [major status effect]{mechanic:major-status-effect}.  Multi-turn trapping moves like []{move:wrap} will hit the doll for their [regular damage]{mechanic:regular-damage}, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.

Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., []{move:avalanche}, []{move:counter}, or a []{item:rowap-berry}.  []{move:magic-coat} still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like []{move:absorb} are healed as normal.

A Pokémon affected by []{move:yawn} before summoning the doll will still fall to [sleep]{mechanic:sleep}.

The doll blocks []{ability:intimidate}, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for [HP]{mechanic:hp} (such as []{ability:volt-absorb} absorbing []{move:thunder-wave}), such moves will not be blocked.

[]{item:life-orb} and berries that cause [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} still work as normal, but their respective [HP]{mechanic:hp} loss and [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} are absorbed/blocked by the doll.

The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the [field]{mechanic:field}, such as by []{move:pursuit} or []{move:spikes}; however, the doll will block the [poison]{mechanic:poison} effect of []{move:toxic-spikes}.

The doll is passed on by []{move:baton-pass}.  It keeps its existing [HP]{mechanic:hp}, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.
