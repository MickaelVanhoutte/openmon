A move counts as targeting the user even if it hit multiple Pokémon, as long as the user was one of them; however, moves targeting the [field]{mechanic:field} itself do not count.  If the user has not been targeted by an appropriate move since entering the [field]{mechanic:field}, or if no Pokémon that targeted the user remains on the [field]{mechanic:field}, this move will [fail]{mechanic:fail}.

Moves that [fail]{mechanic:fail}ed, [miss]{mechanic:miss}ed, had [no effect]{mechanic:no-effect}, or were [block]{mechanic:block}ed are still copied.

Assist moves, time-delayed moves, “meta” moves that operate on other moves/Pokémon/abilities, and some other special moves cannot be copied and are ignored; if the last move to hit the user was such a move, the previous move will be used instead.
